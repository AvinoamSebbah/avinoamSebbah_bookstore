# React Exercice Balink (5 Days)

## Goal : Create a book store website

 - Use React

 - Create all pages (below mockup)
   - Home page will display stores
   - Store page will display books available in this store
   - Product details page will display the details of the product
   - Cart page will display the details of your cart
   - Finalize order page is a form to put information of the client
   - Thanks page will display the order id and thanks the client

 - The integration of the mockup needs to be responsive (big screen, regular screen, Ipad, Mobile, etc...). So for your advice in css, use px  - only when you need to (better to use rem, clamp()).

 - All api needs to be done with graphql queries. The method is post and here the url : https://logical-calf-89.hasura.app/v1/graphql

 - Here a sandbox that you can play with : https://studio.apollographql.com/public/balink-candidate?variant=main
 
 - For style, you don’t use any library (Bootstrap, Material design,etc...) and use styled-components. You can use library for icons like  - font-awesome, take images for the mockup on internet, and find a logo too.

 - Use ES6 features for example don’t use loop for and use const and let for variable, etc….

 - Your code needs to be available in git. The name of the repository needs to be your fullName_bookstore

 ## Bonus : 
 - Dockerize your application
 - Add a module language for minimum 2 language where you think in all pages
